# Bankruptcy Prediction Model

 This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning models to predict bankruptcy using a combination of financial datasets. The project aims to leverage different classifiers to accurately predict bankruptcy based on financial metrics.

# Introduction
The "Bankruptcy Prediction" project is designed to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy based on financial data. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide a reliable model for identifying companies at risk of financial distress.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a combination of two datasets: "Financial Distress" and "American Bankruptcy." The combined dataset includes various financial metrics such as current assets, net income, EBIT, retained earnings, and total liabilities.

# Model Training and Evaluation
The project includes the implementation of multiple machine learning models, including:

1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Gradient Boosting
4. XGBoost
5. CatBoost
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. Naive Bayes
8. Logistic Regression
9. Linear Discriminant Analysis
10. Decision Trees
11. AdaBoost
12. LightGBM

Each model is trained and evaluated using a consistent pipeline and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
